This project is for my course in Mobile programming.

The app is created for makeup. 
The app has three views: home, search, and favorites.

My project uses this API: https://github.com/karenheyn/MakeupAPI

NOTE: The application was first developed in another repository, but when it broke, it was moved to this one.
